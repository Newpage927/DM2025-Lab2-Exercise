    "For this lab we have divided the assignments into **three phases/parts**. The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "### 1.1 Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the raw text data for analysis, I implemented a custom cleaning function `clean_text_improved` that focuses on retaining emotional signals while removing noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Noise Removal:** Removed URLs, user mentions (`@username`), and HTML tags using regular expressions.\n",
    "* **Emotional Punctuation Retention:** Unlike standard cleaning which removes all punctuation, I specifically **retained exclamation marks (`!`) and question marks (`?`)**.\n",
    "    * *Reasoning:* These symbols are strong indicators of intensity and specific emotions (e.g., \"!!\" for surprise/anger, \"?\" for confusion/fear).\n",
    "* **Normalization:** Converted all text to lowercase and stripped extra whitespace.\n",
    "* **Character Filtering:** Removed non-alphabetic characters (except for the retained punctuation) to reduce vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text data into numerical vectors, with specific parameters tuned for this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **N-gram Range (1, 3):** I included Unigrams, Bigrams, and Trigrams.\n",
    "    * *Reasoning:* Single words often lack context (e.g., \"happy\"). Phrases like \"not happy\" or \"really angry\" (captured by bi/trigrams) describe the sentiment much more accurately.\n",
    "* **Max Features (30,000):** Expanded the vocabulary to the top 30,000 features.\n",
    "    * *Reasoning:* Since I used LinearSVC, which handles high-dimensional sparse data well, increasing the feature space allowed the model to capture more subtle language patterns without suffering from immediate overfitting.\n",
    "* **Sublinear TF:** Applied `sublinear_tf=True` (logarithmic scaling).\n",
    "    * *Reasoning:* This reduces the impact of extremely frequent words (like \"the\", \"is\") that don't contribute much to sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final submission, I chose the **LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Classification)** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Configuration:** I used `C=0.5` to provide stronger regularization compared to the default `C=1.0`, helping to prevent overfitting on the training data.\n",
    "* **Why LinearSVC?**\n",
    "    * It is known to scale better to large numbers of samples and features compared to standard SVC.\n",
    "    * In text classification tasks where the feature space (TF-IDF) is high-dimensional and sparse, LinearSVC often finds the optimal hyperplane more effectively than Logistic Regression.\n",
    "    * It focuses on the samples that are hardest to classify (support vectors), which is beneficial for distinguishing between similar emotions.\n",
